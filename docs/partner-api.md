  "deliveryAddress": {
    "street": "9 Le Loi",
    "ward": "Hoan Kiem",

}
```

Responses:

- `201 Created`: shipment created.
- `200 OK`: same idempotency key and same request body, old response replayed.
- `409 Conflict`: same idempotency key with different body, or shipment lifecycle rule conflict.

Create shipment writes an audit row to `PartnerApiRequestAudits` for authenticated requests. The audit stores metadata and request hash only, not raw payload or secrets.

## Tracking

GET /api/v1/partner/shipments/{trackingCode}

The API client can only read shipments linked to its own shop/client.

## Cancel

```http
POST /api/v1/partner/shipments/{trackingCode}/cancel
Authorization: Bearer {api_key}
```

```json
{
  "reason": "Customer cancelled order"
}
```
